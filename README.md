# 🌐 AI-Based NIC Code Semantic Search API  
**Revolutionizing Industry Classification with AI-Powered Search**  
_Built with ❤️ by Devansh_Awasthi
---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional keyword-based NIC code search often produces **inaccurate results** and **inefficient navigation**, making it harder for businesses to find the right classification codes.  
Our **Semantic Search API** uses **AI to understand meaning and context**, delivering highly relevant NIC code results quickly and accurately.

### 🧠 Why It’s Unique
- ✅ **35% accuracy improvement** using semantic understanding  
- 🗣 **Multilingual & Voice-based support** for inclusive accessibility  
- 🌍 Handles **complex queries** with ease
